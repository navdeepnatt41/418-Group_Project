Contributing to the incident was the air traffic control tower team’s nondetection of the AAL106 crew’s deviation from taxi instructions while performing concurrent operational tasks; the timing of the runway status light system, which activated too late to prevent the AAL106 crew from crossing the runway hold short line; and American Airlines’ lack of adequate risk controls to prevent concurrent flight crew tasks from leading to distraction, loss of situational awareness, and deviation from an authorized taxi clearance. Reducing the severity of the incident, and likely preventing an accident, was the activation of the ASDE-X warning in the air traffic control tower and the local controller’s prompt cancellation of DAL1943’s takeoff clearance.","Personnel issues - Psychological - Attention/monitoring - Task monitoring/vigilance - Pilot of other aircraft, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Action - Incorrect action performance - Pilot of other aircraft, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Action - Lack of action - ATC personnel, Environmental issues - Operating environment - Airport facilities/design - Runway lighting - Timing of related info, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Safety programs - Adequacy of safety program - Operator, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Indicating/recording systems - Data recorders (flight/maint) - Design",,"40.641300000000001","-73.778099999999995","BOEING, BOEING","737-900ER, 777-223","AIR, AIR","KJFK","John F.
