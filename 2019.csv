The incorrect wiring caused the antiskid system not to function as intended, resulting in the failure of the left outboard tire and a significant loss of the airplane’s braking ability, which led to the runway overrun. Contributing to the accident were (1) Saab’s design of the wheel speed transducer wire harnesses, which did not consider and protect against human error during maintenance; (2) the Federal Aviation Administration’s lack of consideration of the runway safety area dimensions at Unalaska Airport during the authorization process that allowed the Saab 2000 to operate at the airport; and (3) the flight crewmembers’ inappropriate decision, due to their plan continuation bias, to land on a runway with a reported tailwind that exceeded the airplane manufacturer’s limit. The safety margin was further reduced because of PenAir’s failure to correctly apply its company-designated pilot-in-command airport qualification policy, which allowed the accident captain to operate at one of the most challenging airports in PenAir’s route system with limited experience at the airport and in the Saab 2000 airplane.","Personnel issues - Task performance - Maintenance - Scheduled/routine maintenance - Other, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Landing gear system - Main landing gear - Incorrect service/maintenance, Aircraft - Aircraft oper/perf/capability - Performance/control parameters - (general) - Attain/maintain not possible, Personnel issues - Action/decision - Info processing/decision - Decision making/judgment - Pilot, Environmental issues - Conditions/weather/phenomena - Wind - Tailwind - Decision related to condition, Organizational issues - Development - Design - Equipment design - Manufacturer, Aircraft - Aircraft systems - Landing gear system - Land gear sys wiring - Design, Organizational issues - Management - Policy/procedure - (general) - Operator, Organizational issues - Support/oversight/monitoring - Oversight - Oversight of operation - FAA/Regulator, Environmental issues - Operating environment - Airport facilities/design - (general) - Decision related to condition",,"53.898333999999998","-166.54417000000001","Saab","2000","AIR","PADU","Unalaska","false","2","TP","SCHD",,"121","Substantial","VMC","Peninsula AviationServices Inc.,","Landing","Completed",,"Final","https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=100437","https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA20MA002.aspx"
