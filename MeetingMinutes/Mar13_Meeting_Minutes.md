**Meeting minutes: (Attendees — Angela, Oli, Lora, Nav)**

- Participants each went over their 3 visualization ideas 
- As a group we determined which visualization each individual would be responsible 
- Discussed on how we want to clean data and what range do we want to focus on
- Determined that we should focus on a 10-year period
- Discussed whether or not we should include the data for 2025 or leave it will 2024
- Nav pointed out that we should also look at the social media aspect to this, types of articles, frequency of articles, etc.
- Date range 01/01/2015 -- 02/28/2025
- Incorporating data from this year will allow us to create the ML portion of the project
- Angela will send over CSV file and add to github (complete and posted in the data tab)

- **Goal for this week before next meeting: Create your visualization of your chosen idea that was voted upon by the group**

**Visualization Tasks** 
Ang: Create a visualization that compares Makes of planes and the broad phase of flight (approach, initial climb, landing) [STACKED BAR CHART] 

Nav: Plot accident data over a set of years with respect to location. We could plot accident points on an Earth map and also study which regions comparatively got the most accidents over time [SCATTERPLOT] 

Oli: Time between accident date and report publication with a heatmap or bar chart visualization to identify if reports are being published more quickly in recent years, potentially indicating that there is increased scrutiny. [HEATMAP] 

Lora: Line graph of number of flight incidents over time. Use separate lines for fatalities, non fatal injuries, and non-injuries [LINE GRAPH]

Yesui: TBD

**End Goal Deliverable:**  Input traits {make, model, etc}  —> output { % chance of accident}    

**Next meeting tentatively — Friday TIME--TBD**
